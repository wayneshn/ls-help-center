# Add connections

In order for Logic Sheet to automatically talk to third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft Teams, you must first connect those apps to Logic Sheet. This will give Logic Sheet secure access to send data to those apps.

On the action step of your automation builder, you can select a wide range of action types. But some actions need your authorization, such as Slack. You can not use those actions if you don't authorize them first.

![Send a Slack message is disabled because Slack is not authorized](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png>)

In order to connect to third-party services, click the "Add connections" button and you will see a page to connect to those services.

On the "Connect to services" page, you can have an overview of which apps you have authorized and which ones you haven't.&#x20;

To authorize new apps, click "Connect" in the corresponding service. To disconnect apps that you already connected, click "Disconnect."
