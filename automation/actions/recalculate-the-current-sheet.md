# Recalculate the current sheet

This action will simply hard refresh the selected worksheet.&#x20;

This action is useful if you use custom formulas in your worksheet and you want them to retrieve the latest results. For example, if you have a [LogicSheetAPI](../../functions/pull-from-an-api/the-logicsheetapi-formula.md) formula working in a worksheet and you want the formula to refresh once every hour, you can set up an hourly time-driven trigger and run this action.
