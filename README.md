Get Logic Sheet from [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/logic_sheet_automate_your_spreadsheets/796322869198).

Use Logic Sheet to automate your Google Sheets tasks.

You can use Logic Sheet to set up automated workflows in Google Sheet that run when

-   At a specific time
-   Every hour, day, week, or month
-   When the spreadsheet is edited
-   When a Google Form is received
-   When you receive a webhook response
-   When a new row is inserted

To set up an automation with Logic Sheet, you need to choose a **trigger**, set **conditions** on which the automation will run, and choose at least one **action** to run when the automation is triggered.
