Use Logic Sheet to automate your Google Sheets tasks. Logic Sheet lets you automate your spreadsheets with action rules, which allow you to send notifications when editing or form submissions occur or at designated times.

With Logic Sheet, you can set up triggers that initiate specific actions upon certain events, such as when a cell is edited or a form is submitted, or at a predetermined time.&#x20;
